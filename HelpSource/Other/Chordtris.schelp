summary::A musical Tetris clone written in SuperCollider

section::Idea
Chord Tetris is a Tetris clone which adds musical aspects to the classic game concept. The bricks falling from above are associated with a random chord and can be controlled with a MIDI keyboard.

section::Control
A MIDI Keyboard can be used to control the chords as follows:

If you have no MIDI keyboard available, you can also play Chord Tetris with a regular computer keyboard (but it's not as much fun!).

table::
  ## strong::Action:: || strong::MIDI Keyboard:: || strong::Keyboard::
  ## Rotate Right || play chord inversion (up) || Cursor up
  ## Rotate Left || play chord inversion (down) || -
  ## Move Right || play scale (up) || Cursor right
  ## Move Left || play scale (down) || Cursor left
  ## Let brick fall down || play low key tone || Cursor down

Chord Tetris listens to all MIDI Input interfaces available. If your MIDI Controller was not detected, you should try restarting Chord Tetris. If this doesn't help, you should check your MIDI System Settings (e.g. with the Application Audio/MIDI-Setup on Mac OS X).

section::Starting, stopping and pausing the game

The Game can be started using the menu at the top of the screen (Chordtris -> New Game). While the game is running, it can be paused and resumed in the same menu. You can cancel a game by pressing the ESC key. Alternatively, you can use the following shortcuts:

table::
  ## strong::Action:: || strong::Shortcut::
  ## New Game || Cmd + N
  ## Pause / Resume || P
  ## Cancel Game || ESC
::


section::Preferences

You can access the game preferences from the main menu (Chordtris -> Preferences) or with the Shortcut Cmd+,.
The following parameters can be adjusted:

table::
  ## strong::Parameter:: || strong::Description:: || strong::Default Value::
  ## Music Volume || Sound volume of the background music || 0.4
  ## Sound Volume || Volume of the game sounds || 0.3
  ## Keyboard Volume || Volume of the MIDI Keyboard notes || 0.5
  ## Chord Name Language || Note language to display chord names on bricks. This is adjustable because in different languages the note names are different. || English
